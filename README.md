SNAP PRODUCT CO-PURCHASING NETWORK ANALYSIS

In this project, I analyze a dataset on amazon co-purchasing network of products. At first, the main focus is to analyze how the products in different categories like books, DVD, videos are being co purchased.

And then I will use the same dataset which is meta-data of the first amazon co-purchasing network to create a recommendation system based on the co-purchasing data and other relevant metrics like average rating, word stemming of the book categories and total reviews.
